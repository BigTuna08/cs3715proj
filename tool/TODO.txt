TODO in decreasing importance
- processing moves and updating map
- turn timer both on client and server
- saving the game to the db permanently
- loading a saved game

GAME LOGIC FLOW SKETCH
timer end turn on client (visual only, automatically submits when done)
manually click end turn//done
	submit moves://done
		SERVER
		update individual player turn number (so turn=1 means stored moves were for turn 0)//done
		store moves for player//done
		CLIENT
		starts polling for other players moves//done
			SERVER
			server checks all player turn numbers are equal//done
			if timer expired+seconds for autosubmit passed, set moves to none for absent players (probably closed browser)
				and increment their turn counters
			if all equal sends move set
				and increments lobby turn//done
				and sets turnstarttime to current time
			if not responds wait
			CLIENT
			if not waiting
			recieves moveset//done
			recieves turnstarttime (because if they guess it'll be off by a few seconds depending on polling)
			updates game map//99% of code here
			if lose condition notify resignation
				SERVER
				removes player from game
				set player  activity to none
				if only one player remains
					delete lobby, unregister lobby, 
			if win condition alert("u r winner")//no need to tell server they'll figure it out
			sends map to server//duplicated by nnumber of players but that's ok//done
				SERVER
				server stores map in lobby to be used for reconnecting players//done
