GAME LOGIC FLOW SKETCH
timer end turn (visual only, automatically submits when done)
manually click end turn
	submit moves:
		SERVER
		update individual player turn number (so turn=1 means stored moves were for turn 0)
		store moves for player
		CLIENT
		starts polling for other players moves
			SERVER
			server checks all player turn numbers are equal
			if timer expired+seconds for autosubmit passed, set moves to none for absent players (probably closed browser)
				and increment their turn counters
			if all equal sends move set
				and increments lobby turn
			if not responds wait
			CLIENT
			if not waiting
			recieves moveset
			updates game map//99% of code here
			if lose condition notify resignation
				SERVER
				removes player from game
				set player  activity to none
				if only one player remains
					delete lobby, unregister lobby, 
			if win condition alert("u r winner")//no need to tell server they'll figure it out
			sends map to server//duplicated by nnumber of players but that's ok
				SERVER
				server stores map in lobby to be used for reconnecting players
